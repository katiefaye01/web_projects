        <h2>Single Crochet</h2>
        <p> To start off your single crochet stitch, you'll have to make your foundation chain. The foundation chain guide is found on the "Step 2" tab. Once you have that made, turn your piece to where the chain is on the left. From there, you'll put your crochet hook into the last stitch you made. You should now have two loops on your hook. Do yarn over the hook, and pull through the first loop closest to the end of your hook. Then yarn over agin, and pull through both loops on your hook. Now you should have the first single crochet of your project.</p>

        <h2>Double Crochet</h2>
        <p>Just like the single crochet, you need to start your piece off with your foundation chain stitches. Add three additional chain stitches past the desired length of your project. Yarn over your hook, then insert your hook three stitches down from where it is. Yarn over again, and pull through the chain stitch. You should see three loops around your hook. Yarn over, and pull through the first two. One last time, yarn over, and pull through the remaining stitches. You should have finished your first double crochet stitch. Go through each stitch until the end of the piece, then add three chain stitches, and turn your project to where it's on the left side again.</p>
