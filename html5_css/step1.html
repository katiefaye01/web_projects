            <h2>What You Need to Begin</h2>
            <p>To start off, you'll need to gather some supplies before you start your first project. The basics would include your crochet hook, yarn, and a pair of scissors. Make sure that you have the correct size hook for the type of yarn that you'll be using. If you don't know what size hook you need, every skein of yarn should have the suggested hook size on the packaging. A few extra supplies I recommend gathering would include stitch markers, tapestry needles, stuffing, and safety eyes. The stitch markers are to help keep count of how many stitches you doing. Tapestry needles are used to sew on 3D or flat crochet pieces to your project. Lastly, if you desire to make a plush, you'll need stuffing, and safety eyes for those projects. The stuffing I recommend would be Poly-Fil stuffing, and you can find all of these supplies at your local craft store. </p>

            <h3>Knowing the Stitches</h3>
            <p>Your basic stitches to learn would include the chain stitch, single crochet, double crohcet, and the magic ring. The chain stitch is used to start off most flat crochet pieces. Double crochet stitches are good for making blankets, as they use less yarn than a single crochet stitch. When making a 3D crochet piece, such as a plush, you'll have to use the magic ring stitch. I enjoy using the single crochet stitch within my 3D pieces. For learning stitches, such as the double crochet, you'll have to learn your chain, and single crochet first. </p>
